# Java Object-Oriented


## What is OOP?
- is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.


## Cons
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

## Classes and Objects
- In Java, an object is created from a class

Object − has states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class − a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
