## SOLID
* is an acronym for five other class-design principles: 
 - Single Responsibility Principle : asserts that a class or module should do one thing only. 
 - Open-Closed Principle : states that code entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
 - Liskov Substitution Principle :any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent without things blowing up.
 - Interface Segregation Principle:you don't want to force clients to depend on things they don't actually need.
 - Dependency Inversion Principle :encourages you to write code that depends upon abstractions rather than upon concrete details.

* SOLID is a structured design approach that ensures your software is modular and easy to maintain, understand, debug, and refactor.
