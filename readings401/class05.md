# Linked Lists

- A linked list is a collection of data elements that are arranged in a specific order. A node in a linked list may represent a data unit. Each node has two components: data and a pointer to the next node.
- Data components, unlike arrays, are not located in contiguous locations. A linked list is made up of data elements or nodes that are linked together by pointers.
- A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.

## linked list properties:
- It can be visualized as a chain of nodes where each node contains the location of the next node .
- The first node of the linked list is called the head of the linked list
- The last node of the linked list is pointing to NULL

## Types of Linked List:

* Singly Linked List 
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List

## complexity:

* time: O(n) (worse case) the node which has the value that searches for it is last

* space: O(1) This because there is no additional space being used
