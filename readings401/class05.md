# Linked Lists

- A linked list is a collection of data elements that are arranged in a specific order. A node in a linked list may represent a data unit. Each node has two components: data and a pointer to the next node.
- Data components, unlike arrays, are not located in contiguous locations. A linked list is made up of data elements or nodes that are linked together by pointers.
