# Java Basics #

### Java is a programming language. ###

### Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more. ###

- Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

- Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

- Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.

- Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

## compile code ##

Compiling a Java program is very easy after JDK installation. Following are the steps 

- Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program. Assume it's C:\.

- Type 'javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set).
