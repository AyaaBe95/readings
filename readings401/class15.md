- A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

## Tree Terminologies

- Node : is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
- Edge: It is the link between any two nodes.
- Root: It is the topmost node of a tree.
-  height of node: is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf
- depth of node: is the number of edges from the root to the node.
-  degree of node: is the total number of branches of that node.
-  Forest: A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.

# Binary Tree Data Structure
- A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children.

## A Binary Tree node contains following parts.
- Data
- Pointer to left child
- Pointer to right child

## Types of binary trees:
- Full Binary Tree: every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
- Perfect Binary Tree: every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
- Complete Binary Tree
- Degenerate or Pathological Tree:having a single child either left or right.
- Skewed Binary Tree: tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes

# Binary Search Tree(BST)

- Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.
- It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.

## properties:
- All nodes of left subtree are less than the root node
- All nodes of right subtree are more than the root node
