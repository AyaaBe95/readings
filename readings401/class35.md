# Graphs

- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## common terminology

- Vertex 
- Edge 
- Neighbor
- Degree

## Directed vs Undirected

- An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
- A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic
- A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
- A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

## Graph Representation
- An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix
- An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.

## Weighted Graphs
- A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges.

## Traversals
- Breadth First
- Depth First
