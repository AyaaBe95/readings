# Espresso

- Use Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.
- It lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. 
- Espresso Test Recorder writes tests based on the Espresso Testing framework, an API in AndroidX Test. 

## How it works?
- record the interactions with a device 
- add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of the app.
- then it takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test

## Record an Espresso test:
Espresso tests consist of two primary components:
- UI interactions:It includes tap and type actions that a person may use to interact with the app.
- UI assertions:It verifies the existence or contents of visual elements on the screen.

### Add assertions to verify UI elements:
- Click Add Assertion.
