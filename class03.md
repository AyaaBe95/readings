## Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots and it uses to communicate with github. ##


## There are three stages to use git  (Git flow A-C-P):

- ### Git add:the intention to upload files from PC to GitHub. ###

- ### Git commit: save the changes to be redy to upload files to GitHub. ###

- ### Git push:upload the file to GitHub.



> ## Git is like travelling from intention(add stage) to buy a ticket(commit stage) to travelling(push stage).
