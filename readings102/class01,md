- ### we talked today about markdown, it is a markup language, we use it to control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists. In fact, markdown is very useful.


- ### Furthermore, we learned how to create a GitHub account and we did several installations in order to be ready for our journey in software development.

## At the end of the day we had to submit several tasks in order to practice more and enhance what we learned.
