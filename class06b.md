#### The earliest computers were made of wood and metal.By the 20th century,computers started using electrical components,there components were very large and sloComputers started ou as basic calculators,but now we can use them to play games,talk to each other,control robots and other crazy things. ###

## **How Computers Work: What Makes a Computer, a Computer?** ### 

#### Computers are thinking machines and to design a thinking mahine it requires a four differnet tasks: ####
- #### *inputs* #####
- #### *store information* ####
- #### *processing* #####
- #### *outputs* #####

### Binary data is data whose unit can take on only two possible states, traditionally labeled as 0 and 1 ###

## Circuits and logics ##

### Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate. ###

##  CPU, Memory, Input & Output ##

- #### The memory is the storage area where all the inputs are stored before processing and the outputs are stored after processing of inputs. ####
- #### A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program. ####
