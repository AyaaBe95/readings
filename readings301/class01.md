- Flexible layouts, Media queries and Flexible media.

## Media Queries

With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.
Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally 
on large screens and stacked vertically on small screens. **

* Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions.

* Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width of the viewport respectively.
