# Flexbox and Templating #

## JavaScript templating ##
- Javascript Templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.
- The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
- Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `) 
- Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). 
- The expressions in the placeholders and the text between the backticks (` `) get passed to a function.

## Mustache ##
- Mustache is a simple web template system. It is available for many programming languages including JavaScript and Java.
- It is named Mustache because of heavy use of braces { }.
- Mustache is described as a logic-less template engine because it does not have any explicit control flow statements, such as if and else conditionals or for loops.

## Flex-box ##
- container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
- Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container, using flexible widths and heights
- elements can be aligned to fill a space or distribute space between elements, which makes it a great tool to use for responsive design systems.
