## **Introduction to CSS**


# *What is CSS?
> ### CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. ###

> ### CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

> ### CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.

# **Notes**
- ### CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look. ###
- ### Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to and declarations that indicate what these elements should look like). ###
- ### Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements. ###
- ### CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page. ###

## Color in CSS:
- ### Color not only brings a site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions. ###
- ### There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names. ###
